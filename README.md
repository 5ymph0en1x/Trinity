Here's a proof-of-concept that illustrates the use of GodRays analysis, Fast Fourrier Transforms and Geometric Brownian Motions to gain an edge over the markets. We have dedicated a lot of time to ensure stability and robustness to this algorithm. It starts by caching historical data (in order to speed up its treatment) then it analyzes the latest data and after that, the decision process kicks in.
