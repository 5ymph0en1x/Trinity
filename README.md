Here's a proof-of-concept that illustrates the use of Fast Fourrier Transform to analyse cyclical events. We have dedicated a lot of time to ensure stability and robustness to this algorithm. It starts by caching historical data (in order to speed up its treatment) for several minutes and then comes the analysis and after that, the decision process kicks in.
